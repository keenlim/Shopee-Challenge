# Shopee-Challenge

### Main objective: 
- To improve the UI design of ShopeePay platform to reach out to more audience. 

### Problem Definition
While silver generation in Singapore are actively using Shopee to purchase things online, most of them are not inclined to use ShopeePay as a payment method.
Therefore, we would like to improve the interface of the ShopeePay platform to encourage more utilisation of ShopeePay among the older generation.
